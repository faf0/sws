About
=====

Framework for a webserver that I developed for the course CS631 at Stevens Institute
of Technology.
The server supports IPv4 and IPv6.

Build
=====

To build the code, run 'make' on a command-line in the folder where Makefile
is located.
The resulting binary is called 'sws'.

Run the sws in debugging mode (command-line option -d) to see output on stdout.
